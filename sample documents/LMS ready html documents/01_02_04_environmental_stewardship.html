<h1>2.4 Environmental Stewardship</h1>

<p>As human populations grow, so too does the impact we have on the environment. Municipalities need to mitigate the negative impact of their communities.</p>
<p>Eco-friendly ways of supplying water and managing waste is one way municipalities care for the environment. Proper wastewater treatment prevents pollutants from contaminating rivers and lakes, protecting ecosystems and recreational water sources. Municipalities that invest in sustainable water infrastructure, such as rainwater harvesting systems, are also preparing for future challenges like water scarcity.</p>
<p>Programs like Toronto&rsquo;s Green Bin organic waste collection exemplify how municipalities can leverage innovative initiatives to achieve environmental goals. The program reduces the amount of garbage sent to landfills. This has a cascading impact on environmental sustainability. As it decomposes, organic waste in landfills produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Municipalities can significantly cut emissions by diverting this material to composting facilities. These facilities create nutrient-rich compost that can be reused in agriculture and landscaping. Toronto&rsquo;s success with the Green Bin program demonstrates its environmental benefits and feasibility in reducing reliance on finite landfill sites as urban populations grow.</p>
