<h1>1.1 What are Municipal Services?</h1>

<p>Municipal services are the foundation of Canadian communities. They provide important infrastructure, safety, and support for economic and social well-being. Cities, towns, and rural municipalities manage services like clean water, waste management, public safety and recreation. Understanding these services is important for effective municipal administration.</p>
<p>In the image below, municipal services are grouped into six categories. Expand each category to see what&rsquo;s included in each area. In the following screens, we&rsquo;ll explore each category in more detail.</p>
