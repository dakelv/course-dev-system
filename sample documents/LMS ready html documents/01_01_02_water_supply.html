<p>Canadian municipalities manage important infrastructure to ensure safe water supplies, provide water treatment and sewage disposal.</p>
<h2>Clean Water Supply</h2>
<p>Municipalities provide their residents with clean, safe water. This involves collecting water from a source, treating it, and delivering it to the homes, schools, hospitals, and businesses in the community. In Canada, most people take clean drinking water for granted. However, many Indigenous communities still face long-term boil-water advisories, with limited access to safe drinking water. This stark reality underscores a failure to provide basic services equitably, leaving these communities at risk of health problems caused by contaminated water.</p>
<h2>Drainage</h2>
<p>Land drainage systems are essential in urban areas to manage excess water from rainfall, storms, and surface runoff. Without proper drainage, cities can experience waterlogging, flooding, and property damage, leading to public health crises and environmental degradation. These systems also help maintain navigable roads, prevent erosion, and protect local waterways from excess pollutants carried by stormwater.</p>
<p>Land drainage systems efficiently redirect, store, or filter water, promoting the resilience of urban infrastructure, safeguarding natural ecosystems, and improving residents' quality of life.</p>
<h2>Wastewater Treatment </h2>
<p>Municipalities treat and dispose of wastewater. This includes collecting sewage from homes and businesses and cleaning it before releasing it into the environment. Â Over time, these systems need to be upgraded and modernized. Take Montreal as an example. The city is working to modernize its aging wastewater treatment facilities to meet current environmental standards.</p>
