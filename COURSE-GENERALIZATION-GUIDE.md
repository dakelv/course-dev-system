## üöÄ Using the System

### Step 1: Prepare Your Course Documents

1. **Create course directory**: `course-data/{COURSE-ID}/uploads/`
2. **Upload syllabus**: Must contain Program and Course information
3. **Add supporting documents**: Learning outcomes, course outlines, etc.

**Example Syllabus Structure:**
```
Program:
Business Diploma

Course:
Strategic Management (MGMT 301)

Course Description:
This course covers strategic planning, competitive analysis...
```

### Step 2: Run the System

```bash
# Process any course
node src/main.js MGMT-301

# The system will automatically:
# - Extract course context (Business ‚Üí Strategic Management)
# - Generate business-specific activities
# - Use business-focused search queries
# - Apply business assessment criteria
```

### Step 3: Review Generated Content

The system produces:
- **Course Blueprint** - Tailored to your subject area
- **Learning Activities** - Subject-specific templates and examples
- **Production Specifications** - Appropriate for your discipline
- **Assessment Framework** - Aligned with subject standards

2. **Extend ActivityTemplates** - Add subject-specific templates
3. **Configure SearchService** - Add domain and source mappings
4. **Update ProductionGenerator** - Add subject requirements

### Example: Adding Psychology
```javascript
// In course-context-extractor.js
subjectAreaMap: {
    'psychology': ['psychology', 'mental health', 'behavioral', 'cognitive'],
    // ...
}

// In subject-activity-templates.js
'psychology': {
    reading: {
        sources: ['Psychology textbooks', 'Research journals', 'Case studies'],
        examples: ['APA publications', 'Canadian Psychological Association']
    },
    activities: ['Case analysis', 'Research projects', 'Behavioral observations']
}
```

## üìä Quality Assurance

### Automatic Validation
- **Context Extraction**: Verifies Program/Course information found
- **Subject Classification**: Confirms appropriate subject area mapping
- **Template Selection**: Ensures subject-specific templates applied
- **Source Relevance**: Validates search domains and sources match subject

### Manual Review Points
- **Subject Area Accuracy**: Verify auto-classification is correct
- **Activity Relevance**: Ensure generated activities fit the discipline
- **Source Authority**: Confirm recommended sources are appropriate
- **Assessment Alignment**: Check criteria match subject standards

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Subject area not detected correctly
**Solution**: Check syllabus format, ensure Course row contains subject keywords

**Issue**: Generic activities generated instead of subject-specific
**Solution**: Verify subject area classification, add keywords to mapping if needed

**Issue**: Inappropriate sources recommended
**Solution**: Check search service domain mapping, add subject-specific domains

**Issue**: Assessment criteria don't match discipline
**Solution**: Review activity templates, ensure subject-specific criteria defined

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable detailed logging
DEBUG=true node src/main.js COURSE-ID

# Check course context extraction
node test-course-generalization.js
```
