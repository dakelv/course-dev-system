<p>Up to this point, you have been introduced to the appropriate
managerial strategy and structural variables that align with the
organization&#x2019;s contextual variables. We have also considered the
relationship of rewards and motivation. From this point forward, we will
focus on the design of a compensation system.</p>
<p>In this learning outcome, you will gain insight on compensation mix
options such as <strong>base pay, performance pay and indirect
pay</strong>, including the advantages and disadvantages of each.</p>
<p>Then, in the next outcome, we will dive deeper into each of these
compensation components considering the different alternatives within
each of the mix options.</p>

<p>Caption: Employer Intent</p>
<p>[[/style]]</p>
<p>Understanding the employee/employer relationship is important before
we begin learning about the compensation mix options.</p>
<p>In Canada, the CRA articulates the determination of this
relationship. It is important for companies and their management to
understand the difference between an <strong>employee/employer</strong>
relationship compared to a <strong>contractor/organization</strong>
relationship.</p>
<p>[[style:request]]</p>
<p>Creator+ jumbo callout</p>
<p>The difference is determined by the <strong>intention</strong> of the
relationship. Is it a contract <strong>of</strong> service or a contract
<strong>for</strong> service? A contract of service is an
<strong>employee relationship</strong>. A contract for service is a
<strong>business relationship</strong>.</p>
<p>[[/style]]</p>
<p>A contract of service is formalized through the acceptance of a
position with a company by an individual. Terms and conditions of
employment are set-out and agreed to by both parties. Alternatively,
with a contract for service, the organization is setting out
expectations for the delivery of specified services with another company
or with an individual.</p>

<h2 id="instructions-1">Instructions </h2>
<p>Given the obvious additional premium costs for mandatory benefits and
the need to collect, manage and submit mandatory benefits and payroll
taxes to CRA, why would a company choose a contract of service versus a
contract for service?</p>
<p>[[style:transcript]]</p>
<p>Sample Answer</p>
<p>Companies may jump to a decision to secure a contract for service
(Contractor) to avoid payroll taxes and administration of these taxes.
However, caution is needed and consultation with experts is required as
the relationship can be challenged with consequences for the
company.</p>
<p>As stipulated by CRA, &#x201C;An employer who fails to deduct the required
CPP contributions or EI premiums has to pay both the employer&#x2019;s share
and the employee&#x2019;s share of any contributions and premiums owing plus
penalties and interest&#x201D; (CRA, n.d.)<em>.</em></p>

<p>Organizational compensation systems can include any combination of
these three fundamental compensation components (Base, Performance, and
Indirect Pay). For example, a company may compensate employees with base
pay plus only the mandatory benefits required. Or perhaps the company
compensates purely on commissions (performance pay) along with the
required mandatory benefits. Many large organizations will have a
compensation system that includes all three components.</p>
<h2 id="compensation-mix-choices">Compensation Mix Choices</h2>
<p>Your compensation mix choices are:</p>
<h2 id="base-pay">Base Pay</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Job evaluation</p></li>
<li><p>Market pricing</p></li>
<li><p>Pay for knowledge</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="performance-pay">Performance Pay</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Individual performance</p></li>
<li><p>Group performance</p></li>
<li><p>Organization performance</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="indirect-pay">Indirect Pay</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Mandatory benefits</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>Pension plan</p></li>
<li><p>Health and life insurance</p></li>
<li><p>Pay for time not worked</p></li>
<li><p>Employee services</p></li>
<li><p>Other benefits</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But then the question is, what percentage of total compensation
should each component represent? Should base pay be 80% of total
compensation with 10% performance and 10% indirect? These questions
become more complex if the organization considers different compensation
options for different job categories (job families).</p>
<p>Consider a car dealership as an example. Here, different categories
of positions receive different compensation mix rewards. Study this
table:</p>
<table>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>Given the number of options available, how do companies determine the
optimal compensation mix? The answer to this question comes back to the
<strong>purpose of the compensation system &#x2013; to help create a
willingness among qualified persons to join the organization &amp; to
perform the tasks needed by the organization.</strong></p>

<h1 id="section"></h1>
<p>[[style:calloutRight]]</p>
<p><strong>Base pay</strong> represents <strong>compensation for time
worked</strong>. It is differentiated between a <em>wage</em> or a
<em>salary,</em> with a wage representing a dollar value per hour,
versus a salary which is represented as a weekly, monthly, or annual
amount.</p>
<p>[[/style]]</p>
<p>&#x201C;Base pay tends to reflect the value of the work or skills and
generally ignores differences attributable to individual employees&#x201D;
(Milkovich, et al., 2017, p.&#xA0;6). For example, a company will have a base
pay for the position of seamstress of $20/per hour. Employees working as
a seamstress may begin at this base wage and then receive increases to
their base pay through <a href="">merit</a> pay increases, or <a
href="">cost-of-living adjustment (COLA)</a>, or regular increments
based on years of service as outlined in a collective bargaining
agreement or employment contract.</p>

<h1 id="common-base-pay-methods">4.2.3 Common Base Pay Methods</h1>
<p>Determining if and to what extent base pay will be leveraged, is only
one decision that needs to be made by organizations. The method to
determine the amount of base pay for each job still needs to be
established and implemented.</p>
<p>There are three common base pay methods: <strong>Job Evaluation,
Market Pricing, and Pay for Knowledge.</strong> There are many factors
that are relevant in determining how to determine base pay. It is common
for companies to use more than one of these methods in the determination
of the amount of base pay to pay their employees.</p>
<p>[[style:request]]</p>
<p>Create the following using H5P Jumbo Callout.</p>
<h2 id="base-pay-1">Base Pay</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Job evaluation</p></li>
<li><p>Market pricing</p></li>
<li><p>Pay for knowledge</p></li>
</ul>
<p>[[/style]]</p>
<p>Each of these three methods will be examined further in the next
Learning Outcome.</p>
<p>In designing a compensation system, the employer needs to reflect on
the <a href="">purpose of their compensation system</a>. Also, the
company needs to consider the behaviours that they need from their
employees and how the compensation can motivate the desired
behaviour.</p>
<p>More and more, companies are leveraging compensation strategies that
provide some certainty to employees along with motivation towards
performance through performance pay options. In the next lesson, we will
examine the different options related to performance pay.</p>

<p>Performance pay is &#x201C;any type of financial reward provided only when
certain specified performance results occur (Long &amp; Singh, 2018,
pg.103).</p>
<p>[[/style]]</p>
<p>Generally, base pay in Canada represents 75% to 80% of total
compensation while <strong>performance pay</strong> represents
approximately 5 to 10% of total compensation (Long &amp; Singh, 2018).
The ratio of performance pay is highly dependent on the industry. For
example, car sales, consulting or financial advising may include
commissions in excess of 50% of total compensation.</p>
<p><strong>Performance pay</strong> which is based on some measure of
performance, is a shift from the entitlement aspect of base pay.&#xA0; Recall
that with base pay, if an employee attends work and performs well enough
to maintain employment, then they are entitled to be paid the same as
their peers.&#xA0; With performance pay, a company seeks to encourage and
motivate employees to some pre-established outcomes or measures.&#xA0; Such
performance and respective performance pay can be related to individual,
group or organizational performance. The following graphic illustrates
the different performance pay options.</p>

<h1 id="advantages-and-disadvantages-of-performance-pay">4.3.2
Advantages and Disadvantages of Performance Pay</h1>
<p>Performance pay have some advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<h2 id="advantages">Advantages</h2>
<p>Let&#x2019;s consider why an organization may want to include performance
pay in its compensation system. Performance Pay plans can:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Motivate employees to perform specific behaviours or meet desired
goals;</p></li>
<li><p>Minimize the need for mechanisms or processes to control employee
behaviour as their pay is dependent on performing desired
behaviours;</p></li>
<li><p>Engage employees in understanding current performance and
performance that leads to higher pay;</p></li>
<li><p>Align well with the organization&#x2019;s ability to pay its employees
because performance pay is variable. Unlike base pay, performance pay is
more flexible.</p></li>
<li><p>Be leveraged as a mechanism to support specific managerial
strategies.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>[[style:note]]</p>
<p>Use Dotted Underline with Tooltip for the following.</p>
<p>Assumes most employees work to satisfy their social needs and that
employees inherently dislike their work.</p>
<p>[[/style]]</p>
<p>For example, group-based options can support both <a href="">human
relations</a> and <a href="">high-involvement</a> strategies. Individual
performance pay can support the <a href="">classical</a> managerial
strategy. Group and organization plans can support the high-involvement
strategy.</p>
<h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>
<p>Given the advantages stated above, why are performance plans not used
by all companies or to a greater extent (beyond 5 to 10% of total
compensation)? Perhaps because there are some disadvantages:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>While performance pay aligns with an organization&#x2019;s ability to
pay, employees tend to prefer the certainty of base pay over the risk of
compensation based on performance.</p></li>
<li><p>When performance pay is a bonus above base pay, or is a small
portion of total compensation, then acceptability among employees does
exist.</p></li>
<li><p>If the performance measures are set by management without
consultation of employees and especially if they are aggressive targets,
employees will be unable to achieve the targets and can actually be
de-motivated by the performance pay option.</p></li>
<li><p>Conflict and mistrust can become problematic between employees
and management.</p></li>
<li><p>One of the biggest drawbacks of performance pay is the limitation
to one or a few behaviours while other important desired behaviours are
ignored.</p></li>

<p>[[style:transcript]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sample Answer</p>
<p>Employees will focus on increasing their production level but this
could be at the expense of quality. A negative consequence of an
inadequate performance pay plan is the focus on one specific behaviour
at the expense of other behaviours or goals. A more appropriate
performance option would be a bonus based on both quantity and quality
measures.</p>

</ol>
<p>[[style:transcript]]</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sample Answer</p>
<p>This company needs senior staff to train and mentor new staff. While
performing this duty, the senior staff will have less time to meet the
sales targets for the bonus. As such, seasoned employees&#x2019; motivation and
commitment to train is limited. The training may be rushed or put aside
by senior staff. This in turn discourages new employees resulting in
high turnover of new employees. A more effective performance pay option
would be a group-based option such as group commissions or goal
sharing.</p>

<p>Practical and properly structured performance pay options can be
beneficial to organizations. Once again, companies need to base their
decisions on the <a href="">purpose of their compensation system</a> and
the desired behaviours (membership, task, and organization citizenship)
that they need from their employees.</p>
<p>In the next learning outcome, we will dive deeper into each of the
options for individual, group and organizational performance pay
options. In the next step, let&#x2019;s look at the third component of a

<p>Let&#x2019;s begin by identifying and classifying the different types of
employee benefits. It is important to understand that there are both
<strong>mandatory</strong> and <strong>voluntary</strong> benefits that
form the array of employee benefit offerings.</p>
<h2 id="mandatory-benefits">Mandatory Benefits</h2>
<p>Recall at the beginning of this learning outcome, we said that it is
not possible for a company to have 100% of their compensation costs be
attributable to base pay alone. The reason is due to the requirement for
all Canadian companies to administer and pay premiums for three
mandatory employee benefits:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Employment Insurance (EI)</p></li>
<li><p>Canada Pension Plan (CPP)</p></li>
<li><p>Workers&#x2019; Compensation (WCB)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Employees often don&#x2019;t associate these programs as employee benefits
but consider why they exist: to provide safety and financial security in
the case of a workplace accident, possibility of job loss and future
source of income upon retirement.</p>

<p>For the following, create Dotted Underline with Tooltip:</p>
<p>Costs are shared between the employer and the employee.</p>
<p>[[/style]]</p>
<p>It is important to understand who is responsible for the cost of
these benefits. In the case of EI and CPP, both the employer and the
employee pay premiums to the programs. This is referred to a <a
href="">contributory plan</a>. WCB premiums, on the other hand, are paid
for entirely by the employer. This is referred to as a <a
href="">non-contributory plan</a>.&#xA0;</p>
<p>While these mandatory benefits are not important from a recruitment
or retention perspective, every company with employees, must factor the
costs of the premiums into the total compensation costs. Due to these
mandatory benefit costs, companies may consider if alternative
employment relationships such as contracted services should be
incorporated into operations. Such a decision will impact other
structural variables such as job design, control and
decision-making.</p>

<p>There is one more employee benefit that is legislatively required -
vacation. The Canada Labour Code establishes the requirements for two
weeks of vacation leave or vacation pay after completing a year of
employment. Provinces can improve upon this legislated benefit. In
Saskatchewan, The Saskatchewan Employment Act provides for a minimum of
3 weeks of vacation leave after one year of employment.</p>
<p>Employees that work full-time hours will be provided paid time off
for vacation based on the jurisdiction they work in or, in some cases,
the jurisdiction of their employer. Employees that work less than
full-time hours will receive pro-rated paid time off or the employer may
pay the benefit out to employees each pay period.</p>
<p>Similar to the mandatory benefits, employers must ensure that they
consider the cost of this paid-time-off benefit in their workforce
planning and payroll budgeting.</p>
<h1 id="reading-vacation-benefits">4.4.7 Reading: Vacation Benefits</h1>

<p>Costs of benefits are shared between the employer and the
employee.</p>
<p>[[/style]]</p>
<p>These voluntary benefits can be contributory plan, non-contributory
plan, or employee-financed. Considering how the benefit will be funded
is an important step in determining what options to incorporate into the
compensation mix of base, performance and indirect compensation.
Representing 10 to 20 % of total compensation in Canada (Long &amp;
Singh, 2018, p.&#xA0;105), the choice of which employee benefit to introduce
requires comprehensive analysis including the probability of escalating
costs and the relationship to the objective to attract, retain and
motivate qualified individuals. In the next learning outcome, we will
look at these benefits closer.</p>
<h1 id="pros-and-cons-of-indirect-compensation">4.4.9 Pros and Cons of
Indirect Compensation</h1>
<p>Indirect compensation can be costly and given the lack of flexibility
in modifying or eliminating them, organizations need to complete
comprehensive analysis including a cost/benefit analysis. Such employee
benefit programs can support:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Attraction</p></li>
<li><p>Retention</p></li>
<li><p>Motivation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>However, they can also create an <strong>entitlement
mentality</strong> among employees given there is <strong>no</strong>
direct correlation to employee performance.</p>

<p>Throughout this learning outcome, the different components of the
compensation mix were outlined. There is no one correct ratio of base,
performance, and indirect pay that an organization will employ. Instead,
each organization will strive to align the mix with its strategic goals
and the key behaviours that it requires of its employees.</p>
<p>To solidify your learning of the concepts presented in this learning
outcome, you will assess your knowledge in a quiz that is combined with
LO5 and LO6 (Quiz #2).</p>
<h2 id="looking-ahead">Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>In the next learning outcome, we will examine, more specifically, the
array of employee benefit options.</p>
