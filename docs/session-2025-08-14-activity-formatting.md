# Session: MUNI-201 Activity Format Optimization & Phase B Implementation
**Date**: August 14, 2025  
**Duration**: Extended development session  
**Focus**: Student-centered activity formatting and enhanced Phase B agent integration

## üéØ Session Objectives Achieved

### 1. **Activity Format Standardization**

- **Solution**: Comprehensive reformatting to student-centered design
- **Result**: Clean, accessible learning activities with direct resource access

### 2. **Reading Activity Enhancement**
- **Transformation**: Removed instructor-focused sections (Objective, Instructions, Deliverable, Assessment)
- **Added**: Direct URLs to government resources and policy documents
- **Enhanced**: 6 critical thinking questions per reading activity
- **Focus**: After-reading analysis connecting theory to municipal administration practice

### 3. **Visual Content Activity Redesign** 
- **Changed From**: Production instructions for graphic artists
- **Changed To**: Student viewing and analysis activities
- **Format**: [GRAPHIC PLACEHOLDER] with viewing instructions and analysis questions
- **Purpose**: Students analyze completed visuals rather than create them

### 4. **Assignment Type Standardization**
- **Updated**: "Reflection" activities ‚Üí "Assignment" activities
- **Updated**: "Analysis" activities ‚Üí "Assignment" activities  
- **Maintained**: Consistent terminology for better course organization
