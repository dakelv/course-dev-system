# Context Manager Implementation Design

## Overview
The Context Manager serves as the orchestration backbone for the AI Curriculum Design System, maintaining coherent state across 11 specialized agents and managing complex multi-phase workflows.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Context Data Structures

**Primary Context Schema:**
```json
{
  "project_id": "string",
  "course_info": {
    "title": "string",
    "code": "string", 
    "credits": "number",
    "institution": "Saskatchewan Polytechnic",
    "lms_platform": "Brightspace"
  },
  "workflow_state": {
    "current_phase": "A|B|C|QA",
    "active_agents": ["agent_names"],
    "completed_checkpoints": ["checkpoint_ids"],
    "pending_reviews": ["review_ids"]
  },
  "agent_outputs": {
    "instructional_designer": {},
    "curriculum_architect": {},
    "business_analyst": {},
    "assessment_specialist": {},
    "ui_ux_designer": {},
    "content_marketer": {},
    "lms_integrator": {},
    "api_documenter": {},
    "docs_architect": {},
    "code_reviewer": {},
    "test_automator": {}
  },
  "context_memory": {
    "decisions": [],
    "patterns": [],
    "issues": [],
    "todos": []
  },
  "timestamps": {
    "created": "ISO_8601",
    "last_updated": "ISO_8601",
    "phase_transitions": {}
  }
}
```

**Agent Handoff Protocol:**
```json
{
  "handoff_id": "string",
  "from_agent": "string",
  "to_agent": "string",
  "context_package": {
    "essential_context": {},
    "agent_specific_data": {},
    "dependencies": [],
    "validation_requirements": []
  },
  "handoff_status": "pending|in_progress|completed|failed"
}
```

### 2. Memory Management Strategies

**Context Compression Levels:**

**Level 1 - Active Context (< 2000 tokens):**
- Current phase objectives and constraints
- Recent agent outputs and decisions
- Active dependencies and blockers
- Immediate next steps

**Level 2 - Session Context (< 5000 tokens):**
- Complete current phase context
- Key decisions from previous phases
- Integration points and handoff data
- Quality assurance checkpoints

**Level 3 - Project Context (< 10000 tokens):**
- Full project history and rationale
- All agent outputs and interactions
- Complete decision tree
- Comprehensive documentation links

**Level 4 - Archived Context (Stored in memory):**
- Historical patterns and solutions
- Performance benchmarks
- Lessons learned database
- Template library

### 3. Agent Coordination Workflows

**Phase A Coordination (Parallel):**
```
Context Manager
├── Initialize Phase A context
├── Distribute course materials to 3 agents
├── Monitor parallel processing
├── Collect and merge outputs
├── Validate integration points
└── Prepare Human Review Checkpoint 1
```

**Phase B Coordination (Parallel):**
```
Context Manager
├── Process Phase A approval
├── Generate Phase B context packages
├── Coordinate 3 parallel agents
├── Manage cross-agent dependencies
├── Validate content alignment
└── Prepare Human Review Checkpoint 2
```

**Phase C Coordination (Sequential):**
```
Context Manager
├── Process Phase B approval
├── Sequence technical agents
├── Manage technical dependencies
├── Coordinate API integrations
├── Validate technical outputs
└── Prepare Human Review Checkpoint 3
```

### 4. Context Distribution Protocols

**Agent-Specific Context Packages:**

**For Educational Agents (Phase A):**
- Raw course materials and learning objectives
- Institutional standards and requirements
- Previous course examples and templates
- Pedagogical constraints and preferences

**For Content/Design Agents (Phase B):**
- Approved educational framework
- Course structure and learning pathways
- Target learner personas and contexts
- Brand guidelines and accessibility requirements

**For Technical Agents (Phase C):**
- Complete course blueprint
- Technical specifications and constraints
- Integration requirements and APIs
- Quality standards and compliance needs

**For QA Agents (Continuous):**
- Current system state and configurations
- Quality metrics and validation criteria
- Security requirements and compliance standards
- Performance benchmarks and optimization targets

### 5. Error Handling and Recovery

**Context Corruption Recovery:**
- Automatic context validation and integrity checks
- Rollback to last known good state
- Context reconstruction from agent outputs
- Manual intervention protocols

**Agent Failure Handling:**
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Alternative agent routing
- Partial output recovery
- Human intervention triggers

**Memory Overflow Management:**
- Automatic context compression
- Selective memory archiving
- Priority-based context retention
- Emergency context purging
