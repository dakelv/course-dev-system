# Session: AI Curriculum Design System Enhancement
**Date**: August 7, 2025  
**Duration**: Extended development session  
**Focus**: Blueprint generation improvements and content quality enhancement

## üéØ Session Objectives Achieved

### 1. **Learning Outcome Extraction Fix**
- **Problem**: System was extracting 16 duplicate learning outcomes instead of the expected 8
- **Root Cause**: Syllabus document contained outcomes in both "Learning Outcomes" section and "Assessment Tools" section
- **Solution**: Enhanced `extractOutcomesFromSyllabus()` method to:
  - Only extract from main "Learning Outcomes" section
  - Stop extraction when hitting "Assessment Tools" or other sections
  - Added safety limit of 8 outcomes with logging
- **Result**: Clean extraction of exactly 8 learning outcomes (LO1-LO8)

### 2. **Content Quality Enhancement**
- **Problem**: Learning activities were generic placeholders that repeated learning step titles
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive content generation system:
  - **Learning Outcome Introductions**: Contextual explanations for each outcome
  - **Learning Step Introductions**: Detailed context for each learning step
  - **Enhanced Activity Templates**: Municipal administration-specific activities
  - **Meaningful Content**: Real scenarios, Canadian municipal examples, practical applications

### 3. **Activity Format Standardization**
- **Problem**: Inconsistent activity naming and unclear team responsibilities
- **Solution**: Implemented standardized format:
  - **Activity Titles**: `x.y.z Activity_Type: Title_of_Activity`
  - **Examples**: `1.1.1 Reading: Foundations of Municipal Service Delivery`
  - **Team Requests**: Clear identification in content body (`**MEDIA PRODUCTION REQUEST**:`)

### 4. **Assessment Enhancement**
- **Problem**: Generic assessment requests without actual content
- **Solution**: Created detailed assessment specifications:
  - **Multiple Choice Questions**: With distractors and correct answers marked with *
  - **True/False Questions**: With explanations
  - **Scenario-Based Questions**: Real municipal administration contexts
  - **H5P Integration**: Specific Brightspace Creator+ requirements

### 5. **Media Production Optimization**
- **Problem**: Too many time-consuming video production requests
- **Solution**: Balanced approach with:
  - **YouTube Curation**: AI-curated videos with embed codes
  - **Graphics Requests**: Professional diagrams and infographics with creation instructions
  - **Limited Video Production**: Only for essential content
  - **Reference Examples**: Links to professional examples and inspiration
