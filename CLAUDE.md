# AI Curriculum Design System - Project Context

## Project Overview
Building an AI-powered curriculum design system for post-secondary institutions with two main phases:

### Phase 1: Blueprint Generation
- **Input**: Course materials (ebooks, PowerPoint, Word docs, approved syllabus with learning outcomes)
- **Process**: AI analysis and curriculum design using educational best practices
- **Output**: Comprehensive blueprint with learning activities, assessments, and structure

### Phase 2: Activity Generation & LMS Integration  
- **Input**: Approved blueprint + original course materials
- **Process**: Automated generation of LMS-ready learning activities
- **Output**: Complete course content ready for deployment

## Technical Assessment
- **Feasibility**: ‚úÖ Highly feasible with current AI capabilities
- **Timeline**: MVP in 2-3 months, full system in 6-12 months
- **Approach**: Multi-modal AI + structured prompting + template engine + quality assurance

## Specialized Educational Agents Created

   - Learning theory expert (Bloom's taxonomy, ADDIE, backward design)
   - Adult learning principles and cognitive load theory
   - Pedagogical framework specialist

2. **curriculum-architect.md** üìö
   - Course structure and learning pathway design
   - Competency mapping and standards compliance
   - Modular design and prerequisite analysis

3. **assessment-specialist.md** üìä
   - Formative/summative assessment design
   - Rubric creation and authentic assessment
   - Learning analytics and evaluation strategies

4. **lms-integrator.md** üîó
   - Platform integration (Canvas, Moodle, D2L, Blackboard)
   - SCORM/xAPI standards and API automation
   - Accessibility compliance and mobile optimization

## Agent Workflow Strategy
Designed pipeline: instructional-designer ‚Üí curriculum-architect ‚Üí assessment-specialist ‚Üí lms-integrator

## Next Development Areas
- System architecture planning
- Document processing pipeline design
- Blueprint template creation
- LMS integration testing

## Project Status
‚úÖ Educational agents designed and implemented
‚úÖ Sample documents analyzed (MUNI-201 course package)
‚úÖ Process understanding complete (SME ‚Üí ID ‚Üí Media ‚Üí Course Production workflow)
‚úÖ Technical architecture designed and documented
‚è≥ Ready for component-level detailed design

## Discovery Questions Prepared
**Input Materials & Processing:**
1. Document formats and typical volumes
2. Syllabus structure and learning outcomes format
3. Course material characteristics and subject coverage
4. Institutional standards and accreditation requirements

## Context Notes
- Project located at: `/home/hu/projects/my-project/course-dev-system/`
- Educational domain expertise now available via specialized agents
- Sample documents analyzed: MUNI-201 complete course package
- System architecture documented in `system-architecture.md`
- Technical stack: IIS frontend + n8n backend + Python document processing
- Processing volume: 1 syllabus + 5-10 PowerPoint/PDFs + 10 Word docs per course

## Current Session Progress (2025-08-06)
‚úÖ **Option 3 Selected**: Technical Architecture Planning
‚úÖ **Requirements Gathered**: 
  - Single-course processing focus
  - Sequential + parallel AI agent workflow
  - Human review checkpoints between phases
  - Dual output format (JSON + Markdown)
  - IIS server frontend with n8n processing backend
‚úÖ **Architecture Document Created**: Complete system design with 5 core components
‚úÖ **Component Design Completed**:
  - Context Manager Implementation (orchestration backbone)
  - Document Processing Pipeline (16-21 files per course)
  - Educational Agent Integration - Phase A (foundation agents)
  - Human Review Interface Design (3 checkpoint validation system)
  - Content & Design Agent Integration - Phase B (content/UX agents)
  - Technical Integration - Phase C (simplified HTML output approach)
  - n8n Workflow Specifications (complete orchestration workflows)
  - AI Agent Service Architecture (LLM integration and processing engine)
  - Implementation Roadmap (24-week development plan)

‚úÖ **Key Design Decisions**:
  - 11 specialized agents working in coordinated phases
  - Simplified Phase C: HTML output + cmp-doc-converter integration (no direct Brightspace APIs)
  - Multi-LLM support with user-configurable API keys (OpenAI, Claude, local models)
  - Preview/download interface for generated learning objects
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout
  - n8n webhook integration: https://learningtechnologies.app.n8n.cloud/webhook-test/course-dev-system

‚úÖ **Architecture Complete**: Full system design from document upload to HTML learning object generation

‚úÖ **Implementation Ready**: 
  - MVP definition (8 weeks): Single course processing with Phase A agents
  - 3-phase development plan (24 weeks total)
  - Technology stack decisions (Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker)
  - Resource requirements and cost estimates
  - Risk management and success metrics

‚úÖ **Simplified Implementation Started**: 
  - Decision made: File-based approach without Docker/databases for proof-of-concept
  - 3-week timeline: Week 1 (foundation) ‚Üí Week 2 (AI agents) ‚Üí Week 3 (HTML generation)
  - Clean project organization: /docs folder for all specs, agents and course-data preserved

‚úÖ **Week 1 Implementation Complete**:
  - Complete project structure with package.json, configuration, and CLI
  - Document processing system (PDF, Word, PowerPoint extraction)
  - File management and logging systems
  - Test environment setup with MUNI-201 sample course
  - Configuration management with .env and JSON config
  - CLI interface: `node process-course.js MUNI-201`

‚è≥ **Current Status**: Week 1 foundation complete, ready for Week 2 AI agent integration
‚è≥ **Next Phase**: AI Agent Service implementation with LLM integration (OpenAI, Claude)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Development Protocol
**IMPORTANT**: When performing todos, do one at a time. Ask for permission to move to next before taking any actions. Long sessions are risky as they have the potential of losing all work previously done.
